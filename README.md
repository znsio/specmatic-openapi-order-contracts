# Central Contract Repository for the Order API

## What is Central Contract Repository?

Please see **[Documentation](https://specmatic.io/documentation/central_contract_repository.html)**

## Backward Compatibility Testing

Backward compatibility between API specifications is now automatically checked using our GitHub Actions workflow. This ensures that changes in your branch are compatible with the main branch before merging.

### How it works:

1. When you push changes to a branch or create a pull request targeting the main branch, the CI workflow is triggered.
2. The workflow identifies changed API specification files (YAML, JSON, and GraphQL).
3. For changed OpenAPI specifications, it runs a backward compatibility check using the Specmatic.
4. For changed GraphQL schemas, it performs a similar check using the Specmatic GraphQL.

## Linting

Below are the instructions to run the linter on your local machine

* Install [spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral#-installation-and-usage)
* Run below command inside the repo
```
spectral lint **/*.yaml 
```
* Above command leverages .spectral.yaml

## Competing examples detection 

Automatically checks for competing examples in OpenAPI specifications located in the `io/specmatic/examples/store/openapi` directory.
